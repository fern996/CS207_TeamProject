About this project
===========

Wouldn't it be great if we are able to build a robotic arm thatâ€™s controlled wirelessly at home? Which also have the capability to move
around the place with the push of a button

In repository we are going to outline the steps and procedures for building an Arduino and Bluetooth controlled robotic arm on a rc 
platform. Both the arm and the rc platform would be controlled manually using an android software.
