About this project
===========

Wouldn't it be great if we are able to build a robotic arm thatâ€™s controlled wirelessly at home? Which also have the capability to move
around the place with the push of a button

In repository we are going to outline the steps and procedures for building an Arduino and Bluetooth controlled robotic arm on a rc 
platform. Both the arm and the rc platform would be controlled manually using an android software.

Build Instructions
==================

robotic arm:

base - for the base i will be using a real of doctape, two cd/DVD. Pieces of card board would need to be fitted into the tape real for          mounting the servo motor using glue. the middle portion of th e first one cd would be removed in order for accommodating the            servo lever. The servo lever is mounted with using glue onto the second cd in the centre. the second cd is been then placed            onto the first affixing the servo lever onto the servo head with a screw.

 shoulder support - for the shoulder we are using card board, and plastic taken from bottle, servo. Three pieces of card board and one                       piece of plastic each with dimensions 3 inches by 2 inches. After or before sandwiching the pieces together with                       the plastic piece on the outer end a triangular portion the size of the servo would need to be removed. as shown in                     the picture a second piece would be cut for providing additional support. Assemble the piece as shown in the                           picture below onto the base.

 shoulder- for the we are using two pieces of card board and two pieces of plastic of dimensions 5.5 inches by 1-inch and two servo                levers. After sandwiching the pieces together with the plastics on the outer end using the drill place one hole 0.5 inches              from  ends in the shoulder. Enter a servo lever on each hole and use small screws to hold them in pace. Your end result                should be looking like the one below.

elbow - for the elbow we are using two pieces of card board and two pieces of plastic with dimensions 8.5 inches by o.34 inch with the           first two inches along the length measuring 1.25 inches. In the middle of the 2 by 1.25 inches portion before or after                 sandwiching the pieces remove a rectangular portion the size of the servo motor case. Your end result should be looking like           the one below.
